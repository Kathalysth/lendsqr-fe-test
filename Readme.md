### _Laas platform for prospective lenders and borrowers_

## Task

Build the 4 progressive web pages `Login`, `Dashboard`,`User page`, `User details page` as provided in the given figma design. The user pages should pull data from a mock api with 500 records. Use local storage or indexedDB to store and retrieve user details on the user details page.The page must be mobile responsive.

## Criteria

- Visual fidelity - your assessment must be picture and pixel perfect - it must be a 100% representation of the Figma design.
- Code quality - well structured and well written.
- Application of best practice in design and architecture.
- Unit testing - you must apply positive and negative scenario testing.
- Variable and function naming, conventions and consistency.
- Semantic use of paths and resource naming.

## Functionality

The App attempts to provide the most natural and basic functionalities as perceived from the figma design, functionalities such as `dropdowns`, `selects`, `navigation` and `state toggle` were enforced.

## Design

I went with the simplistic pixel perfect representation of the figma design.
